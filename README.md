# w11arm_addDrivers - a utility to "remaster" Windows 11 ARM ISO and inject VMware network drivers

## What is w11arm_addDrivers?

w11arm_addDrivers is a utility that "remasters" a Windows 11 ARM installation ISO.
It will inject the VMware vmxnet3 virtual network drivers into a copy of the ISO, creating
a new ISO that can be used to more easily create VMware Fusion virtual machines.

Windows 11 ARM ISOs created by tools other than VMware Fusion's "Get Windows from Microsoft" or vmw_esd2iso
tools do not include the VMware vmxnet3 netwok drivers. This causes a problem during the Windows out-of-box
experience (OOBE) process. Since Windows 11 ARM does not natively contain the VMware network driver, no 
network will be configured for the OOBE processes to find. The installation will be hung up on 
a prompt to configure a network.

Normally manual intervention through a command prompt is needed to proceed past this point. With the ISO created
by w11arm_addDrivers, no manual intervention is needed as the Windows OOBE process will find a network and will proceed normally.

As an additional bonus, the ISO generated by w11arm_addDrivers will be configured to eliminate 
the annoying Microsoft "feature" of "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD...". 
The ISO will boot directly into the Windows setup without additional intervention.

## Prerequisites 

* Apple Silicon Macs running macOS 13 or later.
* VMware Fusion 13.5 or later must be installed and located at /Applications/VMware Fusion.app.

## Usage

```
w11arm_addDrivers [-hV] path-to-Windows11-ISO-file

Where:
	-V:			Print version of utility and exit
	-h			Print usage (help) information and exit
```

## Installation

* Download this project from GitHub: https://github.com/Technogeezer50/2w11arm_addDrivers. The latest released version
can be found in the "Releases" section on the right hand side of the project page. You can download either
the .zip or .tar.gz format file.
* Extract the downloaded file.
* Move or copy the file w11arm_addDrivers to a location of your choice (preferably an empty folder where you will build your ISO)
* Open the macOS Terminal app, and cd to the empty folder.
* Change permissions on w11arm_addDrivers to make it executable (it does not require root permissions).
* Run w11arm_addDrivers.

## Notes

w11arm_addDrivers will check for at least 12 GB of available disk space before doing anything. Approximately 6 GB of that space
is required to extract the source ISO's contents into a temporary imaging folder, and will be released after the new ISO is built. 
The remaining disk space (approximately 5 GB) is needed for the re-mastered ISO.

The recommendation for most users wanting to download a Windows 11 ARM ISO to Windows in a Fusion virtual machine
is to use VMware Fusion's bundled tools. These tools download the latest stable channel installation Windows 11 ARM ESD from
Microsoft, add the network driver, and create the ISO.

w11arm_addDrivers is primarily designed for Windows 11 ARM ISOs that do not contain the VMware network driver such as those created by:

- uupdump.net (Windows Insider Dev, Beta, Canary or Release Preview channels)
- CrystalFetch
- Parallels Desktop
- Any future "consumer" Windows 11 ARM ISO that Microsoft may make available from its websites.

> [!WARNING]
> w11arm_addDrivers is not needed and should not be used on Windows 11 x64 (Intel/AMD 64-bit) ISOs. These ISOs already contain
> the appropriate drivers for VMware hypervisor products that run on Intel/AMD CPUs and operating systems.

## Found a bug?

Please report any bugs as an issue in w11arm_addDriver's repository on GitHub.
