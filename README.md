# w11arm_addDrivers - a utility to "remaster" Windows 11 ARM ISO and inject VMware network drivers

## What is w11arm_addDrivers?

w11arm_addDrivers is a utility that "remasters" a Windows 11 ARM installation ISO.
It will inject the VMware vmxnet3 virtual network drivers into a copy of the ISO, creating
a new ISO that can be used to more easily create VMware Fusion virtual machines.

Windows 11 ARM ISOs created by tools other than VMware Fusion's "Get Windows from Microsoft" or vmw_esd2iso
tools do not include the VMware vmxnet3 netwok drivers. This causes a problem during the Windows out-of-box
experience (OOBE) process. Since Windows 11 ARM does not natively contain the VMware network driver, no 
network will be configured for the OOBE processes to find. The installation will be hung up on 
a prompt to configure a network.

Normally manual intervention through a command prompt is needed to proceed past this point. With the ISO created
by w11arm_addDrivers, no manual intervention is needed as the Windows OOBE process will find a network and will proceed normally.

THe recommendation is for most users is to use VMware Fusion's bundled tools to create a Windows 11 ARM installation
ISO. w11arm_addDrivers gives users of ISOs created from the following sources an easier procedure
for installing Windows 11 ARM in a VMware Fusion virtual machine. 

- uupdump.net (Windows Insider Dev, Beta, Canary or Release Preview channels)
- CrystalFetch
- Parallels Desktop
- Any future "consumer" Windows 11 ARM ISO that Microsoft may make available from its websites.

As an additional bonus, the ISO generated by w11arm_addDrivers will be configured to eliminate 
the annoying Microsoft "feature" of "Press any key to boot from CD or DVD...". 
The ISO will boot directly into the Windows setup without additional intervention.

## Prerequisites 

* Apple Silicon Macs running macOS 13 or later.
* VMware Fusion 13.5 or later must be installed and located at /Applications/VMware Fusion.app.

## Usage

```
w11arm_addDrivers [-hV] path-to-Windows11-ISO-file

Where:
	-V:			Print version of utility and exit
	-h			Print usage (help) information and exit
```

## Installation

* Download this project from GitHub: https://github.com/Technogeezer50/2w11arm_addDrivers. The latest released version
can be found in the "Releases" section on the right hand side of the project page. You can download either
the .zip or .tar.gz format file.
* Extract the downloaded file.
* Move or copy the file w11arm_addDrivers to a location of your choice (preferably an empty folder where you will build your ISO)
* Open the macOS Terminal app, and cd to the empty folder.
* Change permissions on w11arm_addDrivers to make it executable (it does not require root permissions).
* Run w11arm_addDrivers.

## Notes

w11arm_addDrivers will check for at least 15GB of available disk space before doing anything. This space is needed to extract the
contents of an existing Windows 11 ARM ISO into a temporary folder and create a new ISO. The temporary folder
(about 5GB) will be deleted upon successful creation of the new ISO.
